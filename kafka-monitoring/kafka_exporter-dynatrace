When integrating Kafka Exporter metrics with Dynatrace, you'll likely need to set up custom annotations or metrics in Dynatrace to capture and display the Kafka-related information. Here's a general example of how you might annotate Kafka-related metrics for Dynatrace:

Edit Annotations in Dynatrace:

Log in to your Dynatrace account.
Navigate to the application or service where you want to add annotations.
Look for an "Annotate" or "Custom Annotations" section.
Create Annotations for Kafka Metrics:

Define custom annotations for Kafka metrics like kafka_consumergroup_lag_gauge.
Specify the relevant information, such as the metric name, value, and any additional context.
Use Dynatrace API (Optional):

Dynatrace also provides an API that allows you to push custom metrics. You can use this to send Kafka Exporter metrics directly to Dynatrace.
Here's an example using the Dynatrace API (this is just a conceptual example, and you may need to adjust it based on Dynatrace's API specifics):

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST "https://<your-dynatrace-environment>/api/v2/metrics/ingest" \
-H "Authorization: Api-Token <your-api-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '[
  {
    "metricKey": "custom.kafka.lag",
    "dimensions": {
      "consumer_group": "your_consumer_group",
      "topic": "your_topic"
    },
    "timestamp": <current_timestamp>,
    "value": <kafka_consumergroup_lag_gauge_value>
  }
]'
Replace <your-dynatrace-environment>, <your-api-token>, your_consumer_group, your_topic, <current_timestamp>, and <kafka_consumergroup_lag_gauge_value> with your Dynatrace environment details, Kafka-related information, and metric values.
