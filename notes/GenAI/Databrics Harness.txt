**ChatGPT:**

To run a cron job every day at 8:00 AM and 2:00 PM, use the following cron expression:

0 8,14 * * *

Breakdown:

0 – at minute 0

8,14 – at hour 8 AM and 2 PM (14 in 24-hour format)

* – every day of the month

* – every month

* – every day of the week

Example:

If you’re editing a crontab (crontab -e), it might look like this:

bash
0 8,14 * * * /path/to/your/script.sh


Let me know if you want help writing the script or sending emails based on a condition.

**ChatGPT:**

In Quartz cron expression format, the equivalent of running a job daily at 3:00 AM, 8:00 AM, and 2:00 PM is:

0 0 3,8,14 ? * * *

Breakdown (Quartz format has 7 fields):
sql
┌────────────── second (0)
│ ┌──────────── minute (0)
│ │ ┌────────── hour (3,8,14)
│ │ │ ┌──────── day of month (?)
│ │ │ │ ┌────── month (*)
│ │ │ │ │ ┌──── day of week (*)
│ │ │ │ │ │ ┌── year (optional - *)
│ │ │ │ │ │ │
0  0  3,8,14  ?  *  *  *

Explanation:

0 seconds

0 minutes

3,8,14 hours (3 AM, 8 AM, 2 PM)

? day-of-month (use ? when day-of-week is specified or you don’t care)

* any month

* any day of week

* any year (optional)

Let me know if you're using Quartz in Spring or another scheduler, and I can tailor the config for that.

* * *

**You:**

every 6 hours starting at 3 am

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To run a Quartz cron expression every 6 hours starting at 3 AM, use:

0 0 3/6 ? * * *

Breakdown:

0 → seconds

0 → minutes

3/6 → every 6 hours starting at 3 AM (i.e., at 3 AM, 9 AM, 3 PM, and 9 PM)

? → any day of the month

* → every month

* → every day of the week

* → any year (optional)

Explanation:

This fires the job at:

03:00

09:00

15:00 (3 PM)

21:00 (9 PM)

Let me know if you need this configured for Spring Boot, XML, or another scheduler setup.

**You:**

if the databricks job fails i want a scale a k8s service pods to 0

We have harness that we use for our pipeline

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To scale a Kubernetes service to 0 pods if a Databricks job fails, and you're using Harness for your pipeline, you can do this in a clean, automated way by combining:

🧩 Steps Overview:

Run the Databricks job in Harness.

Check the job status after execution.

If it fails, run a K8s step to scale your service to 0 pods using kubectl.

✅ Step-by-Step in Harness (CI/CD Pipeline):
1. Databricks Job Step

Use a custom script step or a REST API step in Harness to trigger the Databricks job.

Capture the job run ID and poll the job status.

2. Conditional Execution

Harness supports conditional execution on step failure. You can use this to run the next step only if the previous one fails.

3. K8s Scale to 0 Step

Add a "Shell Script" step in Harness with conditional execution onFailure.

In the script, scale your deployment or StatefulSet to 0 using kubectl:

bash
kubectl scale deployment <your-deployment-name> --replicas=0 -n <your-namespace>


If it's a StatefulSet:

bash
kubectl scale statefulset <your-statefulset-name> --replicas=0 -n <your-namespace>

🛡️ Requirements:

Harness delegate should have access to your Kubernetes cluster (kubectl configured).

Your service (Deployment or StatefulSet) must be labeled or named consistently.

📘 Optional Enhancements:

Notify a Slack/MS Teams channel when the scale down happens.

Add retries or fallback logic.

**You:**

in harness how do i create a pipeline that has a custom shell script for this requirement 

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Here’s how to create a Harness pipeline with a custom shell script to:

Run a Databricks job,

Check its result,

Scale a Kubernetes service to 0 if the Databricks job fails.

✅ Summary of What You'll Build:

A Harness pipeline with:

A Shell Script step to run the Databricks job.

A Shell Script step (conditionally executed on failure) that scales K8s pods to 0.

🔧 Step-by-Step Guide (Harness UI or YAML):
🛠️ Step 1: Create a New Pipeline

Go to Pipelines → New Pipeline

Name your pipeline (e.g. ScaleDownOnDatabricksFailure)

Choose "Build" or "Custom" stage type

🧩 Step 2: Add Stage > Add Step > Shell Script (Run Databricks Job)
Databricks Job Step:

Script step (inline):

bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Trigger the Databricks job via API
# Replace with your actual job ID and token
JOB_ID=12345
DATABRICKS_TOKEN="your-token"
WORKSPACE_URL="https://<your-databricks-instance>"

# Run job
run_response=$(curl -s -X POST "$WORKSPACE_URL/api/2.1/jobs/run-now" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DATABRICKS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"job_id\": $JOB_ID}")

RUN_ID=$(echo "$run_response" | jq -r '.run_id')

# Poll status
for i in {1..30}; do
  sleep 20
  status=$(curl -s -X GET "$WORKSPACE_URL/api/2.1/jobs/runs/get?run_id=$RUN_ID" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $DATABRICKS_TOKEN" | jq -r '.state.life_cycle_state')
  
  result=$(curl -s -X GET "$WORKSPACE_URL/api/2.1/jobs/runs/get?run_id=$RUN_ID" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $DATABRICKS_TOKEN" | jq -r '.state.result_state')

  echo "Status: $status, Result: $result"

  if [[ "$status" == "TERMINATED" ]]; then
    if [[ "$result" != "SUCCESS" ]]; then
      echo "Databricks job failed."
      exit 1
    else
      echo "Databricks job succeeded."
      exit 0
    fi
  fi
done

echo "Job did not finish in time."
exit 1


📌 Set Failure Strategy to "Continue" (so Harness continues to the next step)

🧩 Step 3: Add Another Step (Shell Script to Scale K8s Pods to 0)
This should be added in the same stage, with Conditional Execution: On Failure of Previous Step

Script:

bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Scaling K8s deployment to 0 due to Databricks failure."

kubectl scale deployment <your-deployment-name> --replicas=0 -n <your-namespace>

⚙️ Conditional Execution:

In the second step’s Advanced Settings:

Set "Run Condition" to:
"Run only when the previous step failed"

✅ Final Notes
Prerequisites:

Your Harness Delegate should have kubectl access to your cluster.

Use a Harness Kubernetes Infrastructure Connector in the stage setup.

**You:**

in my data brics job i am running a notebook which in turn has a sql statement 

i want the shell script to check if the query returns any data

if the sql query returns data, it is a success condition

if the sql query does not return any data it is a failure condition 

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Great — you're triggering a Databricks job that runs a notebook, and you want to determine success/failure based on whether a SQL query in the notebook returns data.

Here’s how to implement that logic so the Harness shell script can check the query result, and fail the step if no data is returned.

✅ Solution Overview

Modify the notebook to:

Run the SQL query

Write the row count or some signal value to the notebook's output (e.g. using dbutils.notebook.exit())

In the Harness shell script, poll the job status via Databricks API, and read the output value to determine success/failure.

🔧 Step-by-Step
✏️ Step 1: Modify Databricks Notebook

At the end of your notebook, count rows and use dbutils.notebook.exit() to return the count.

python
# Run the SQL query
df = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE condition = 'X'")

# Count rows
row_count = df.count()

# Return row count as job output
dbutils.notebook.exit(str(row_count))

🧩 Step 2: Update Harness Shell Script

This script will:

Trigger the job

Wait for it to complete

Fetch the result from notebook_output.result

Exit with success/failure depending on row count

bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Config
JOB_ID=12345
DATABRICKS_TOKEN="your-databricks-token"
WORKSPACE_URL="https://<your-databricks-instance>"

# Start the job
run_response=$(curl -s -X POST "$WORKSPACE_URL/api/2.1/jobs/run-now" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DATABRICKS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"job_id\": $JOB_ID}")

RUN_ID=$(echo "$run_response" | jq -r '.run_id')
echo "Triggered run ID: $RUN_ID"

# Poll for job completion
for i in {1..30}; do
  sleep 20
  response=$(curl -s -X GET "$WORKSPACE_URL/api/2.1/jobs/runs/get?run_id=$RUN_ID" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $DATABRICKS_TOKEN")

  state=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.state.life_cycle_state')
  result_state=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.state.result_state')

  echo "Job status: $state, result: $result_state"

  if [[ "$state" == "TERMINATED" ]]; then
    if [[ "$result_state" != "SUCCESS" ]]; then
      echo "Job failed in Databricks."
      exit 1
    fi

    # Read notebook output
    output=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.notebook_output.result')
    echo "Notebook output (row count): $output"

    if [[ "$output" -gt 0 ]]; then
      echo "Query returned data — SUCCESS"
      exit 0
    else
      echo "Query returned no data — FAILURE"
      exit 1
    fi
  fi
done

echo "Timed out waiting for job to finish."
exit 1

🔒 Requirements

Your Databricks job must be a notebook job.

The notebook must use dbutils.notebook.exit(<row_count>).

Your Harness delegate (or shell script runner) must have:

jq installed (for parsing JSON)

Internet access to Databricks API

💡 Tip

You can also log the row count to MLflow, but using notebook_output.result is the most straightforward way for Harness shell steps.

Would you like me to provide a version with secret management (e.g. HARNESS_SECRET_DATABRICKS_TOKEN), or format this as a full Harness pipeline YAML?

* * *

**You:**

cannot create a shell script. use a container step instead 

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Perfect — if you're using Harness NextGen and cannot use a shell script step, but can use a container step, you can absolutely achieve this by running a container with a script inside it.

Here’s how to do it:

✅ Goal Recap

Use a container step in Harness to:

Trigger a Databricks notebook job via API

Wait for the job to complete

Read notebook_output.result (which should contain row count)

Exit with 0 (success) if row count > 0, else 1 (failure)

🔧 Step-by-Step (Container Step Setup)
🔹 Step 1: Choose Container Image

Use a lightweight image with:

curl for HTTP

jq for JSON parsing

Recommended image: curlimages/curl:latest or alpine with pre-installed tools

Or use a custom image like:

yaml
image: alpine:latest


And install curl and jq inside the step.

🔹 Step 2: Container Step YAML Example

Here’s the container step definition inside your Harness pipeline:

yaml
- step:
    name: Check Databricks Job Result
    identifier: check_databricks
    type: Container
    spec:
      connectorRef: <your-k8s-connector>
      image: alpine:latest
      command: /bin/sh
      args:
        - "-c"
        - |
          apk add --no-cache curl jq

          echo "Triggering Databricks Job..."
          JOB_ID=12345
          DATABRICKS_TOKEN="${DATABRICKS_TOKEN}"
          WORKSPACE_URL="https://<your-databricks-instance>"

          run_response=$(curl -s -X POST "$WORKSPACE_URL/api/2.1/jobs/run-now" \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer $DATABRICKS_TOKEN" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d "{\"job_id\": $JOB_ID}")

          RUN_ID=$(echo "$run_response" | jq -r '.run_id')
          echo "Run ID: $RUN_ID"

          for i in $(seq 1 30); do
            echo "Polling job status..."
            sleep 20

            response=$(curl -s -X GET "$WORKSPACE_URL/api/2.1/jobs/runs/get?run_id=$RUN_ID" \
              -H "Authorization: Bearer $DATABRICKS_TOKEN")

            status=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.state.life_cycle_state')
            result=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.state.result_state')

            if [ "$status" = "TERMINATED" ]; then
              if [ "$result" != "SUCCESS" ]; then
                echo "Databricks job failed."
                exit 1
              fi

              output=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.notebook_output.result')
              echo "Notebook returned: $output"

              if [ "$output" -gt 0 ]; then
                echo "Success: query returned rows."
                exit 0
              else
                echo "Failure: query returned no rows."
                exit 1
              fi
            fi
          done

          echo "Timeout waiting for Databricks job to finish."
          exit 1
      envVariables:
        DATABRICKS_TOKEN: "<+secrets.getValue(\"databricks_token\")>"

📌 Key Notes

Replace:

JOB_ID with your Databricks job ID

WORKSPACE_URL with your Databricks instance (e.g. https://<region>.azuredatabricks.net)

databricks_token with a Harness secret

The container step will exit with 0 on success, and 1 on failure — letting you trigger downstream conditions like scaling your K8s service.

⏭️ Next Step

Now, in the next container step, add a Kubernetes kubectl scale command (also in an Alpine or bitnami/kubectl image), but configure it to run only on failure of this step.

Would you like me to include the follow-up step that scales your K8s deployment to 0 using a container too?
