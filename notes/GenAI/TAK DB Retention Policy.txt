use retention policy and retention jar to trim
tables in TAK db tables

**ChatGPT:**

To trim tables in your TAK database using a retention policy, you'll need to set up rules that automatically delete old or unnecessary data. This often involves specifying a retention period in which the data is kept before being automatically purged. Here’s a general approach using Java (assuming you have a retention JAR for managing retention in TAK DB):

Set Retention Policy in Database:

Use a time-based retention policy. If the TAK database has built-in support, configure the policy directly on the tables. For example, you might set it up to retain data for a specific number of days.

This can be configured through SQL commands if the database supports them. You might run something like:

sql
ALTER TABLE your_table_name SET RETENTION_POLICY TO '7 DAYS';


This depends on the specific SQL dialect or TAK DB capabilities.

Use Retention JAR (if custom):

If a retention JAR is available, you can set up a cron job or scheduled Java application to run periodically.

Within this Java program, you would connect to the database, check each table’s retention policy, and delete any rows that are beyond the retention period.

A sample snippet in Java might look like this:

java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.time.LocalDate;

public class RetentionTrimmer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:your_tak_db_url", "username", "password")) {
            String trimQuery = "DELETE FROM your_table_name WHERE date_column < ?";
            try (PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(trimQuery)) {
                LocalDate retentionDate = LocalDate.now().minusDays(7); // Retain last 7 days
                preparedStatement.setObject(1, retentionDate);
                int rowsDeleted = preparedStatement.executeUpdate();
                System.out.println("Deleted " + rowsDeleted + " rows.");
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


Automate the Trimming Process:

Schedule this Java program to run at regular intervals, like daily, using a cron job or task scheduler.

Ensure proper logging and error handling to monitor any failures in the trimming process.

If you need further customization, such as setting different retention policies for different tables, you could expand this code to include more logic or configure the retention policy in a separate configuration file that the program reads.
