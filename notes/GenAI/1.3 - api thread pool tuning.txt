**You:**

we have tak with nats, ignite, config, api and messaging on k8s in a dedicated node pool

our api dev has 2 nodes with 4 cpu and 8 gi memory , each

our api prod has 3 pods with 8 cpu and 16 Gi, each

we want to tune thread pools for api

what would you recommend 

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To tune the thread pools for your API service in Kubernetes, we‚Äôll base recommendations on:

CPU/memory allocation

Expected concurrency

Whether it‚Äôs I/O or CPU bound

JVM (assuming Java-based API)

Thread pool types (e.g., web server, async, executor)

üîß 1. Assumptions

Let me know if any of these are incorrect:

API is Java-based (Spring Boot, Quarkus, etc.)

You‚Äôre using an embedded servlet container (like Tomcat or Netty)

API handles external I/O (like DB, messaging, etc.)

üìå API Pod Resources

Dev: 2 nodes √ó (4 CPU, 8 Gi) = total 8 CPU, 16 Gi

Prod: 3 pods √ó (8 CPU, 16 Gi) = total 24 CPU, 48 Gi

You should size thread pools based on available CPU per pod, not per cluster. So we‚Äôll focus on per pod tuning.

üîç 2. Tuning Recommendations
‚úÖ Web Server Thread Pool (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty)

These handle incoming HTTP requests.

For Tomcat (Spring Boot defaults):

properties
server.tomcat.max-threads=200       # or 2‚Äì4 √ó CPU
server.tomcat.min-spare-threads=20


Prod suggestion (8 CPU): max-threads = 200‚Äì300
Dev suggestion (4 CPU): max-threads = 100‚Äì150

‚úÖ Async Task Thread Pool (ExecutorService)

Handles internal async tasks (like DB calls, messaging, etc.)

yaml
corePoolSize = CPU
maxPoolSize = 2 √ó CPU
queueCapacity = 1000   # Tune based on traffic


Prod:

corePoolSize = 8, maxPoolSize = 16
Dev:

corePoolSize = 4, maxPoolSize = 8

‚úÖ Messaging / Kafka Consumers (if embedded in API)

If consuming messages from NATS or Kafka:

yaml
concurrency = number of CPU cores (or a bit less)


For 8 CPU, use 6‚Äì8 consumer threads.

üí° General Guidelines
Type	Threads Formula	Notes
Tomcat worker	2‚Äì4 √ó CPU	Handles HTTP requests
Async executor	core: CPU, max: 2 √ó CPU	For DB/messaging/event processing
Kafka/NATS consumer	1‚Äì1.5 √ó CPU	Ensure no starvation with others
üß™ Observability

Add metrics for:

Thread pool queue size

Active thread count

Request latency

Use ThreadPoolTaskExecutor metrics via Micrometer or Prometheus

üîÑ Scaling Advice

If queues are full and threads are always busy ‚Üí scale horizontally first

If underutilized ‚Üí reduce maxPoolSize to free up memory and GC pressure

Would you like me to generate a sample Spring Boot config or YAML snippet for these values?

* * *

**You:**

what are the values i need to have in environment 

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Here‚Äôs a list of recommended environment variables you can configure to control thread pool tuning for your API (assuming a Spring Boot app running on Kubernetes):

‚úÖ Recommended Environment Variables
üî∏ 1. Tomcat Thread Pool

Handles HTTP requests.

Variable Name	Description	Dev (4 CPU)	Prod (8 CPU)
TOMCAT_MAX_THREADS	Max HTTP threads	150	250
TOMCAT_MIN_SPARE_THREADS	Idle thread reserve	20	40

Set in your application.properties or use Spring environment binding:

env
TOMCAT_MAX_THREADS=250
TOMCAT_MIN_SPARE_THREADS=40


Spring Boot auto-binds these if defined as:

properties
server.tomcat.max-threads=${TOMCAT_MAX_THREADS:250}
server.tomcat.min-spare-threads=${TOMCAT_MIN_SPARE_THREADS:40}

üî∏ 2. Async Thread Pool

Used for @Async, internal task executions.

Variable Name	Description	Dev	Prod
ASYNC_CORE_POOL_SIZE	Min async threads	4	8
ASYNC_MAX_POOL_SIZE	Max async threads	8	16
ASYNC_QUEUE_CAPACITY	Pending queue size	500	1000

Example:

env
ASYNC_CORE_POOL_SIZE=8
ASYNC_MAX_POOL_SIZE=16
ASYNC_QUEUE_CAPACITY=1000


Then bind them in Spring config:

yaml
spring:
  task:
    execution:
      pool:
        core-size: ${ASYNC_CORE_POOL_SIZE:8}
        max-size: ${ASYNC_MAX_POOL_SIZE:16}
        queue-capacity: ${ASYNC_QUEUE_CAPACITY:1000}

üî∏ 3. Messaging Concurrency (if applicable)
Variable Name	Description	Dev	Prod
MESSAGING_CONCURRENCY	Number of consumer threads	4	6‚Äì8

Only needed if API consumes from Kafka/NATS directly.

üß© Example: Deployment YAML Snippet
yaml
env:
  - name: TOMCAT_MAX_THREADS
    value: "250"
  - name: TOMCAT_MIN_SPARE_THREADS
    value: "40"
  - name: ASYNC_CORE_POOL_SIZE
    value: "8"
  - name: ASYNC_MAX_POOL_SIZE
    value: "16"
  - name: ASYNC_QUEUE_CAPACITY
    value: "1000"
  - name: MESSAGING_CONCURRENCY
    value: "6"


Would you like help generating the corresponding Spring config or Java @Bean definitions for this?
