**You:**

in databricks i want to write a sql query

my table has year, month and day as column

i want the query to use today‚Äôs date for all of these values

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

In Databricks SQL, you can use built-in date functions to extract the current year, month, and day and use them in your WHERE clause.

Here‚Äôs how you can write the query:

sql
SELECT *
FROM your_table
WHERE year = year(current_date())
  AND month = month(current_date())
  AND day = day(current_date())

Explanation:

current_date() gives today‚Äôs date.

year(), month(), and day() extract the respective parts.

Let me know if your column names are different or if you need to account for timezones.

**You:**

i want to create a job that runs this query 

if there the query returns some data, it should send a success email to a distribution list

if the query does not return any data, it should send a failure email to a distribution losing

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To implement this in Databricks, you can set up a Databricks Job with the following steps:

‚úÖ Overview of What You Need

SQL Query Task: Runs your query.

Notebook Task: Checks if data was returned.

Email Notification: Sends email based on result.

üõ† Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Create the SQL Query

You can create a SQL task or a SQL script to extract data for today's date:

sql
-- Save this as a SQL query or use in notebook
SELECT * 
FROM your_table 
WHERE year = year(current_date())
  AND month = month(current_date())
  AND day = day(current_date())


Save this as a named query or use it inside a notebook (preferred if you want control flow like email logic).

2. Use a Notebook with Control Logic (Recommended)

Create a new notebook, for example: Daily Check Notebook

python
# Databricks notebook (Python)

from datetime import date

# Get today's values
today = date.today()
year, month, day = today.year, today.month, today.day

# Query data
df = spark.sql(f"""
    SELECT * 
    FROM your_table 
    WHERE year = {year} AND month = {month} AND day = {day}
""")

if df.count() > 0:
    # Data found ‚Äî success
    dbutils.notebook.exit("SUCCESS")
else:
    # No data ‚Äî failure
    dbutils.notebook.exit("FAILURE")

3. Create a Databricks Job

Go to Workflows > Create Job

Add a Task:

Type: Notebook

Notebook: Use the one from step 2

Under Notifications:

On success ‚Üí Send email to distribution list

On failure ‚Üí Send failure email

üìß For example:

kotlin
Success email: data-team@example.com
Failure email: alerts@example.com


You can also send to multiple recipients by comma-separating them.

‚úÖ Optional Advanced: Use task value and conditional branching if needed more control.

Let me know if you're using DBSQL, Jobs UI, or Workflows API, and I can tailor the solution further.

**You:**

on both success and failure i am send the same email but the  subject and content of the email would be different 

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Great ‚Äî if you're sending to the same email address(es) but want different content and subject lines depending on success/failure, here's the best way to do it in Databricks:

‚úÖ Solution: Use a Python Notebook to Send Email via Webhook or SMTP

Since Databricks jobs only allow a fixed email body and subject per notification, you need to send the email manually from your notebook based on query results.

üîß Steps:
1. Python Notebook Logic

Use smtplib or a webhook (like SendGrid, AWS SES, or a company SMTP server) to send an email with dynamic content.

Here‚Äôs a full example using Python‚Äôs smtplib and Gmail SMTP (adjust to your provider or corporate SMTP):

python
import smtplib
from email.message import EmailMessage
from datetime import date

# Configuration
SMTP_SERVER = 'smtp.gmail.com'
SMTP_PORT = 587
SENDER_EMAIL = 'your-email@gmail.com'
SENDER_PASSWORD = dbutils.secrets.get(scope='email-creds', key='gmail-password')
RECIPIENTS = ['team@example.com']

# Get today's date
today = date.today()
year, month, day = today.year, today.month, today.day

# Run the SQL query
df = spark.sql(f"""
    SELECT * 
    FROM your_table 
    WHERE year = {year} AND month = {month} AND day = {day}
""")

# Create email content
if df.count() > 0:
    subject = f"‚úÖ Success: Records found for {today}"
    body = f"Records were successfully found in the table for {today}."
else:
    subject = f"‚ùå Failure: No records found for {today}"
    body = f"No records were found in the table for {today}. Please investigate."

# Send email
msg = EmailMessage()
msg['Subject'] = subject
msg['From'] = SENDER_EMAIL
msg['To'] = ', '.join(RECIPIENTS)
msg.set_content(body)

with smtplib.SMTP(SMTP_SERVER, SMTP_PORT) as server:
    server.starttls()
    server.login(SENDER_EMAIL, SENDER_PASSWORD)
    server.send_message(msg)

# Optionally exit with status
dbutils.notebook.exit("Email sent")

üîí Security Tip

Use Databricks secrets for your email password or API key:

bash
databricks secrets create-scope --scope email-creds
databricks secrets put --scope email-creds --key gmail-password

üìå Alternative: Use Webhook/API (e.g., SendGrid, AWS SES, Slack)

If you're not allowed to use SMTP or need better formatting:

Use an HTTP POST to services like SendGrid, Mailgun, or Microsoft Graph Email API.

Let me know your preferred email provider, and I can give you that version.

Would you like this example using a corporate email system (like Office 365, Outlook API, or Amazon SES)?

automated cluster do support auto termination error

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, automated (job) clusters in Databricks do support auto termination, but with some important caveats.

‚úÖ Auto Termination on Job Clusters

Job (automated) clusters are created when a job starts and are terminated automatically when the job completes.

You do not need to explicitly configure auto termination for job clusters ‚Äî they terminate automatically once the job ends (whether successful or failed).

üõë Common Error / Confusion

If you see an error like:

Automated clusters do not support auto termination configuration

That happens when:

You're trying to manually set auto_termination_minutes on a job cluster ‚Äî which is not allowed because job clusters terminate by design after the job runs.

‚úÖ What You Can Do Instead

If you are creating a job cluster in JSON or via API, remove the auto_termination_minutes field from the cluster spec.

‚ùå Invalid in job cluster config:

json
{
  "new_cluster": {
    "spark_version": "13.3.x-scala2.12",
    "node_type_id": "Standard_DS3_v2",
    "num_workers": 2,
    "auto_termination_minutes": 20    <-- ‚ùå REMOVE this
  }
}


‚úÖ Valid job cluster config:

json
{
  "new_cluster": {
    "spark_version": "13.3.x-scala2.12",
    "node_type_id": "Standard_DS3_v2",
    "num_workers": 2
  }
}


If you need a persistent cluster with auto termination after inactivity, use an interactive (all-purpose) cluster, not a job cluster.

üîÅ Summary
Cluster Type	Auto-Termination Support	Notes
Job Cluster	‚úÖ Automatically terminates	Do not set auto_termination_minutes
All-Purpose Cluster	‚úÖ User-configured	Set auto_termination_minutes manually

Let me know if you're creating clusters via UI, REST API, Terraform, or Jobs JSON ‚Äî I can tailor the fix.
