**You:**

start with ignite docker image, add jdk17. set JDK_HOME to jdk17

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To start with an Apache Ignite Docker image and upgrade it to use JDK 17 (setting JDK_HOME accordingly), you can build a custom Dockerfile based on the existing Ignite image, install OpenJDK 17, and update the environment variables.

Here‚Äôs an example Dockerfile based on the apacheignite/ignite image:

Dockerfile
FROM apacheignite/ignite:2.17.0

# Install OpenJDK 17
USER root

RUN yum update -y && \
    yum install -y java-17-openjdk java-17-openjdk-devel && \
    alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk/bin/java 1 && \
    alternatives --set java /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk/bin/java

# Set environment variables to use JDK 17
ENV JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk
ENV JDK_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk
ENV PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

USER ignite

Build the Docker Image:
bash
docker build -t ignite-jdk17 .

Notes:

This uses yum assuming the base image is CentOS-based (which apacheignite/ignite typically is).

If your base image doesn't support yum, or you're getting an error like yum: command not found, let me know ‚Äî we can adapt this for apt, apk, or another base.

Adjust the Ignite version in the FROM line if needed.

Let me know if you want to include other tools (like curl, vim, etc.) or configure Ignite to explicitly use JDK 17 in its startup script.

* * *

**You:**

i got a yum not found error

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Thanks ‚Äî that means the base apacheignite/ignite image you're using is likely built on Alpine Linux, which doesn't have yum. Let's rewrite the Dockerfile using apk, Alpine's package manager, and install OpenJDK 17 that way.

Here‚Äôs the updated Dockerfile:

Dockerfile
FROM apacheignite/ignite:2.17.0

USER root

# Install OpenJDK 17 using apk
RUN apk update && \
    apk add openjdk17

# Set environment variables for JDK 17
ENV JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk
ENV JDK_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk
ENV PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

USER ignite

Build the image:
bash
docker build -t ignite-jdk17 .

Verify JDK version:

You can run a container and verify Java version like this:

bash
docker run --rm ignite-jdk17 java -version


Let me know if you get any apk errors or if the base image turns out not to be Alpine either ‚Äî we can check with cat /etc/os-release in a temporary container.

* * *

**You:**

some basic ignite commands to verify

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Here are some basic Apache Ignite commands you can run inside your container to verify it's working and using JDK 17:

‚úÖ 1. Check Java Version

Make sure JDK 17 is being used:

bash
java -version


You should see something like:

nginx
openjdk version "17.x.x"

‚úÖ 2. Start Ignite Node in Standalone Mode
bash
ignite.sh


This starts a default Ignite node using config/default-config.xml. Watch the logs ‚Äî it should show cluster state, ports, and memory info.

‚úÖ 3. Start Control Script

Use the control script to check node info:

bash
control.sh --help


Then try:

bash
control.sh --baseline


or

bash
control.sh --top


You may need to pass --user and --password if security is enabled.

‚úÖ 4. Run SQL in the Ignite CLI

If you're using Ignite 2.8+, you can interactively run SQL via:

bash
sqlline.sh


Once inside:

sql
!connect jdbc:ignite:thin://127.0.0.1/
!tables


You can also run simple SQL queries like:

sql
SELECT * FROM PUBLIC

**ChatGPT:**

Thanks for the photo ‚Äî the error indicates that openjdk17 is not available in the Alpine repositories used by the Ignite base image (v3.21). That version may not include JDK 17 or the openjdk17 package is named differently or missing altogether.

‚úÖ Fix: Use a Debian-based base image instead

Since Alpine doesn't support JDK 17 easily in this context, the most reliable solution is to switch to a Debian-based base image, like openjdk:17-jdk, and install Ignite manually.

üîß New Dockerfile (Debian-based, JDK 17 + Ignite 2.17.0)
Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-jdk

# Set environment variables
ENV JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/openjdk-17
ENV JDK_HOME=/usr/local/openjdk-17
ENV IGNITE_HOME=/opt/ignite
ENV PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$IGNITE_HOME/bin:$PATH

# Install dependencies and download Ignite
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y curl unzip && \
    curl -L https://archive.apache.org/dist/ignite/2.17.0/apache-ignite-2.17.0-bin.zip -o /tmp/ignite.zip && \
    unzip /tmp/ignite.zip -d /opt && \
    mv /opt/apache-ignite-2.17.0-bin /opt/ignite && \
    rm /tmp/ignite.zip

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /opt/ignite

# Default command to start Ignite node
CMD ["bin/ignite.sh"]

üèóÔ∏è Build the image:
bash
docker build -t ignite-jdk17 .

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run:
bash
docker run -it ignite-jdk17


This gives you full control and guarantees compatibility with JDK 17, avoiding issues from limited Alpine repositories.

Let me know if you prefer to stick with Alpine and we can try alternate package sources, but the Debian route is simpler and more reliable for Ignite + JDK 17.

* * *

**You:**

we want to stare with ignite. the issue is that when installing java, we cannot access alpinelinux.org

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Thanks ‚Äî got it. So:

‚úÖ You want to start with the apacheignite/ignite image (not switch to Debian).

‚ùå But network access to alpinelinux.org is blocked (e.g., by a firewall or proxy), so apk can‚Äôt install openjdk17.

‚úÖ 3 Options to Solve This While Keeping the Ignite Image
Option 1: Manually Copy JDK 17 into the Image

Download JDK 17 manually (e.g., from Adoptium or [Oracle]) on your machine, then copy it into the Docker image during build:

Steps:

Download JDK tar.gz locally (e.g., OpenJDK17U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot_17.0.10_7.tar.gz)

Put it in the same folder as your Dockerfile

Use this Dockerfile:

Dockerfile
FROM apacheignite/ignite:2.17.0

USER root

# Copy JDK to image
COPY OpenJDK17U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot_17.0.10_7.tar.gz /opt/

# Extract and set environment
RUN mkdir -p /opt/jdk17 && \
    tar -xzf /opt/OpenJDK17U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot_17.0.10_7.tar.gz -C /opt/jdk17 --strip-components=1 && \
    rm /opt/OpenJDK17U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot_17.0.10_7.tar.gz

ENV JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk17
ENV JDK_HOME=/opt/jdk17
ENV PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

USER ignite


Then build with:

bash
docker build -t ignite-jdk17-local .

Option 2: Use a Local Proxy Cache (if you control networking)

If your system blocks alpinelinux.org, but you're in a corporate or secured environment, you can configure:

A local proxy (like Squid) to cache Alpine packages

A custom Docker registry mirror (for future builds)

Let me know if you want help setting this up.

Option 3: Use Multi-Stage Build

Use a Debian-based image only for JDK 17, and copy it into the Alpine-based Ignite image:

Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Get JDK from Debian
FROM openjdk:17-jdk AS jdkbuild

RUN mkdir /jdk && cp -r /usr/local/openjdk-17 /jdk/

# Stage 2: Start from Ignite Alpine image
FROM apacheignite/ignite:2.17.0

USER root

COPY --from=jdkbuild /jdk/openjdk-17 /opt/jdk17

ENV JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk17
ENV JDK_HOME=/opt/jdk17
ENV PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

USER ignite


This avoids touching the internet in the final Alpine-based stage. Works great in offline environments.

Would you like me to generate the JDK 17 link or script to download from Adoptium?

* * *

**You:**



* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Thanks for the image ‚Äî the key error is:

lua
/opt/jdk17/bin/java: cannot execute: Exec format error

üö® What This Means:

This usually means the java binary is for the wrong architecture ‚Äî e.g., you copied a macOS or ARM build into a Linux x86_64 container.

‚úÖ Fix It by Using the Correct JDK Binary

If you're running the container on a regular x86_64 Linux environment (Intel/AMD) (most common), download a Linux x64 JDK 17 tarball, such as from Adoptium.

‚úÖ Use this one:

Temurin JDK 17 Linux x64 (tar.gz)

URL: https://github.com/adoptium/temurin17-binaries/releases/latest/download/OpenJDK17U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot.tar.gz

üõ† Updated Dockerfile Example

Make sure you:

Download the tarball above (.tar.gz) on your host machine.

Put it in the same folder as your Dockerfile.

Use this updated Dockerfile:

Dockerfile
FROM apacheignite/ignite:2.17.0

USER root

# Copy correct Linux JDK tarball into the image
COPY OpenJDK17U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot.tar.gz /opt/

# Extract it and set environment
RUN mkdir -p /opt/jdk17 && \
    tar -xzf /opt/OpenJDK17U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot.tar.gz -C /opt/jdk17 --strip-components=1 && \
    rm /opt/OpenJDK17U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot.tar.gz

ENV JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk17
ENV JDK_HOME=/opt/jdk17
ENV PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

USER ignite

WORKDIR /opt/ignite

üß™ To Verify:

After building and running the container:

bash
java -version


You should see something like:

nginx
openjdk version "17.0.x"


Then start Ignite:

bash
./apache-ignite/bin/ignite.sh


Let me know if you want me to write a curl/wget step into the Dockerfile to download the JDK directly.

* * *

**You:**

yes

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Great ‚Äî here‚Äôs a full Dockerfile that:

Starts from the official apacheignite/ignite:2.17.0 image

Downloads the correct Linux x64 JDK 17 tarball from Adoptium

Installs it under /opt/jdk17

Sets JAVA_HOME, JDK_HOME, and PATH

‚úÖ Final Dockerfile (with curl download):
Dockerfile
FROM apacheignite/ignite:2.17.0

USER root

# Install curl to fetch the JDK
RUN apk update && apk add curl

# Download and install OpenJDK 17 (Linux x64 build)
RUN mkdir -p /opt && \
    curl -L https://github.com/adoptium/temurin17-binaries/releases/latest/download/OpenJDK17U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot.tar.gz -o /opt/jdk17.tar.gz && \
    mkdir -p /opt/jdk17 && \
    tar -xzf /opt/jdk17.tar.gz -C /opt/jdk17 --strip-components=1 && \
    rm /opt/jdk17.tar.gz

# Set environment variables
ENV JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk17
ENV JDK_HOME=/opt/jdk17
ENV PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

USER ignite
WORKDIR /opt/ignite

üèóÔ∏è Build the image:
bash
docker build -t ignite-jdk17 .

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run it:
bash
docker run -it ignite-jdk17


Then inside the container:

bash
java -version
./apache-ignite/bin/ignite.sh


Let me know if you want to slim the image after install (e.g. remove curl or APK cache).
