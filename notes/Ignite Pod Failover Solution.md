**You:**

our team builds the TAK software. The software has 5 components. nats, ignite, config, api and messaging

nats is a go application and deployed as a stateful set

ignite is an apache product and is deployed as a stateful set and deployed as a stateful set

config, api and messaging are spring boot applications and deployed as deployments

Ignite is a caching service
when a user uses the application, they service calls from the api and messaging service are registered with a specific ignite pod

if that ignite pod goes down, all the users connected to that ignite pod are pointing to a non existent pod, and the application crashes 

how do i rearchitect my product to work around it

**ChatGPT:**

Thanks for the context — this is a classic case of tight coupling to a specific Ignite node, which goes against Ignite’s design goals as a distributed system.

To make your TAK system more resilient and avoid user sessions crashing when an Ignite pod goes down, **you need to decouple the application’s dependence on a specific Ignite pod**. Here’s a structured re-architecture recommendation:

* * *

### ✅ **1. Use Ignite in Client-Server Mode (Not Server-Only Cluster)**

Ensure your Spring Boot applications (`api`, `messaging`, `config`) **connect to Ignite in client mode** rather than server mode.

* **Current issue**: It sounds like your services are "bound" to a specific server node.
    
* **Fix**: Use `IgniteConfiguration.setClientMode(true)` in Spring Boot apps so they act as **Ignite thin clients** that can connect to any healthy server node.
    

> 🔄 This ensures that if one Ignite pod goes down, the client will automatically reconnect to another node.

* * *

### ✅ **2. Enable Partitioned Cache with Backup Replicas**

If a partitioned cache is used (default in Ignite), make sure **backups are enabled**, so that data is not lost if one pod goes down.

Example in your configuration:

```java
CacheConfiguration<String, SomeObject> cacheCfg = new CacheConfiguration<>("myCache");
cacheCfg.setBackups(1); // Ensures redundancy
```

> 🔁 With this, when an Ignite node (pod) fails, data is still available from another node, and rebalancing happens automatically.

* * *

### ✅ **3. Use Service Discovery Correctly**

If you are not already, enable **Kubernetes IP Finder** or another proper discovery mechanism so Ignite pods can **discover each other dynamically** even as nodes go up and down.

For Kubernetes:

```java
TcpDiscoveryKubernetesIpFinder ipFinder = new TcpDiscoveryKubernetesIpFinder();
ipFinder.setNamespace("your-namespace");
ipFinder.setServiceName("ignite-service");
```

Attach to `TcpDiscoverySpi` in your Ignite config.

* * *

### ✅ **4. Graceful Client Reconnection Handling**

Ensure that the Spring Boot services:

* Retry failed operations
    
* Handle `ClientDisconnectedException` gracefully
    
* Possibly implement a retry with backoff logic
    

* * *

### ✅ **5. StatefulSet vs Deployment for Ignite**

Since Ignite nodes have stable identity (Node ID, IP), it's common to use **StatefulSet**, but it’s not strictly required if you handle discovery via service.

> ✅ Stick with StatefulSet, but make sure you're not binding clients (Spring Boot apps) to a specific pod like `ignite-0`. Instead, use a **headless service** or dynamic IP finder.

* * *

### ✅ **6. Monitor and Auto-Heal the Cluster**

Use **Prometheus + Grafana** or **Ignite metrics export** to monitor cluster health. Set up Kubernetes probes to ensure unhealthy Ignite pods are restarted automatically.

* * *

### ✅ Optional: Use Ignite Thin Clients for Loose Coupling

The Spring Boot apps can connect via Ignite thin client instead of embedded client node:

```java
IgniteClient client = Ignition.startClient(
    new ClientConfiguration().setAddresses("ignite-0:10800", "ignite-1:10800"));
```

> 🧠 Advantage: Thin clients are lightweight and don’t join the cluster, avoiding overhead and tight coupling.

### 🔧 Summary of Actions

| Change | Why It Helps |
| --- | --- |
| Use `setClientMode(true)` in services | Avoid hard binding to specific pod |
| Enable cache backups | Prevent data loss on pod failure |
| Use Kubernetes IP Finder | Auto-discover nodes |
| Handle disconnects in clients | Prevent crashes |
| Use Thin Clients | Optional, better separation |
| Monitor and Heal | Maintain cluster integrity |
